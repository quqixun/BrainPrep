# Dataset Directory

This directory contains original input, and output of every step would also appear here.

## Dataset

In this repo, the dataset is downloaded from [LONI Image Data Archive (IDA)](https://ida.loni.usc.edu/login.jsp).  
Collect and download AD and NC screening sample of ADNI1 and ADNI2, and extract them into this folder.  
Thus, there would be four sub-directories in this floder as shown below:
 
- ADNI1_Screening_AD  
- ADNI1_Screening_NC  
- ADNI2_Screening_AD  
- ADNI2_Screening_NC  

## Template

Create a folder names "Template", copy the template volume from the path:  
```
$FSLDIR/data/standard/MNI152_T1_1mm.nii.gz
```
In which, *$FSLDIR* is the directory where FSL is installed in.
